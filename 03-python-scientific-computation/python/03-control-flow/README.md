# Control Flow

## Branch

Branching occur when decision block creates different outcomes depending on the input.

The `if` statement specifies a block of code to be excecuted when the condition is true.

```python
if testExpression:
     # statements
```

The statement can be paired with `else` statement that specifies a block of code to be executed when the previous condition is false.

```python
if testExpression:
    # statements
else:
    # statements
```

The `else if` statement specifies a new condition when the previous condition is false.

## While Loop

The `while` loop will run a block of code when the condition is true.

```python
while testExpression:
    # statements
```

## For Loop

Used to iterate over a range of value.

```python
for val in range(10):
    # statements
```

Or iterate over a list

```python
numberList = [4, 5, 6, 7, 2]
                                
for val in numberList:
    # statements
```
